    "## Introduction\n",
    "In this competition you will predict how many yards a team will gain on a rushing play in an NFL regular season game.  You will loop through a series of rushing plays; for each play, you'll receive the position, velocity, orientation, and more for all 22 players on the field at the moment of handing the ball off to the rusher, along with many other features such as teams, stadium, weather conditions, etc.  You'll use this information to predict how many yards the team will gain on the play as a [cumulative probability distribution](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cumulative_distribution_function).  Once you make that prediction, you can move on to the next rushing play.\n",
    "\n",
    "This competition is different from most Kaggle Competitions in that:\n",
    "* You can only submit from Kaggle Notebooks, and you may not use other data sources, GPU, or internet access.\n",
    "* This is a **two-stage competition**.  In Stage One you can edit your Notebooks and improve your model, where Public Leaderboard scores are based on your predictions on rushing plays from the first few weeks of the 2019 regular season.  At the beginning of Stage Two, your Notebooks are locked, and we will re-run your Notebooks over the following several weeks, scoring them based on their predictions relative to live data as the 2019 regular season unfolds.\n",
    "* You must use our custom **`kaggle.competitions.nflrush`** Python module.  The purpose of this module is to control the flow of information to ensure that you are not using future data to make predictions for the current rushing play.  If you do not use this module properly, your code may fail when it is re-run in Stage Two.\n",
    "\n",
    "## In this Starter Notebook, we'll show how to use the **`nflrush`** module to get the training data, get test features and make predictions, and write the submission file.\n",

However, while you're iterating on your model it's reasonable to try something out, change the model a bit, and try it again.  Unfortunately, if you try to simply re-run the code, or even refresh the browser page, you'll still be running on the same Notebook execution session you had been running before, and the `nflrush` module will still throw errors.  To get around this, you need to explicitly restart your Notebook execution session, which you can do by **clicking \"Run\"->\"Restart Session\"** in the Notebook Editor's menu bar at the top."
